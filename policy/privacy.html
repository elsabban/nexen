							person easily if combined with another information). </li>

							Article 2-3 of the Guidelines for Protection of Personal Information, which are
							the minimal information necessary for the provision of services by the Company
							in compliance with the fair and legitimate methods. Also, although there might
							be some customers who decline to provide their respective information as set
							forth in the following list, the Company does not prevent such customers from
							using the basic services.</li>
						<li>2-3. List of personal information to be collected at the time of signing up for
							membership:
							<ul>
								<li>- Required information: Desired ID, password, name, gender, date of
									birth, nationality, country, email address and consent to receiving
									email message; and</li>
								<li>- Optional information: Telephone number, postal code, state, city/town,
									street address, name and model of automobile, recent date of tire
									change, currently used tires, and name of tire</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>2-4. The Company will not collect certain types of Personal Information (race
							and ethnicity, philosophy and ideology, place of birth and permanent domicile,
							political preference and criminal record, medical history, health and sex life,
							etc.) that may significantly harm the client’s basic human rights unless having
							obtained the client’s consent in cases where the collectable Personal
							Information are expressly stipulated under the relevant laws or such Personal
							Information is directly related to the provision of services.</li>
					</ol>
					<h5>Article 3. Consent to the Collection of Personal Information</h5>
					<p>3-1. The Company provides the system in such a way that when a client signs up for
						membership, he/she may simply click “Agree” or “Disagree” icons for the purpose of
						the Privacy and Terms of Use, and it shall be deemed agreed when our client clicks
						“Agree” icon for the collection of Personal Information.</p>
					<h5>Article 4. Purpose of Collection and Use of Personal Information</h5>
					<ol>
						<li>4-1. The Company collects the Personal Information of its clients for the
							following purposes:
							<ul>
								<li>- Name, Email: To identify whether the user is an adult for the purpose
									of using the services and to confirm whether the user is an offline
									member.</li>
								<li>- Name, Phone No., Email: To send information on the new services or
									products or event, notice, request for the user’s comment and
									compliance, etc.</li>

									members and provision of special services (tire consulting, reader’s

							</ul>
						</li>

							the information relating to Personal Information and Terms of Use, the Company

						</li>
					</ol>
					<a name="Article5"></a>
					<h5>Article 5: Collection of Personal Information through Cookie</h5>
					<p>5-1. The Company stores all the Personal Information and uses the Cookie system to
						locate the Personal Information from time to time. Cookie is a small volume of
						information to be transmitted from a relevant website to the web browsers (such as
						Netscape, Explorer, etc.). When a customer accesses the website, a computer reads
						the message of Cookie that is located in the web browser of such customer, which
						then locates the additional information of such customer from the customer’s
						computer, and it provides the necessary service to such customer without entering
						the name, etc. of such customer while accessing the website. Cookie only recognizes
						the customer’s computer but not the individual customer in person. Also, such
						customer has the option for using the Cookie system. The customer may (i) allow the
						operation of any and all Cookies, (ii) require his/her confirmation whenever a
						Cookie saves the data or (iii) refuse to save any data in Cookie, upon adjusting the
						internet web browser option ([Tools]→ [Internet Options]→ [Security]→ [Users]).</p>

						Third Party</h5>

							Personal Information of its customers for the purpose of smooth operation of the
							business. In this case, the Company notifies the customers in advance about the
							name of the entrusted company, the scope of Personal Information that such
							company will be entrusted, purpose of the entrusted business, procedure of the
							entrusted business, terms of the entrusted business, via email, phone, in
							writing or through the website. More details on the aforementioned are available
							in Article 12 of the Personal Information Protection Guidelines.</li>
						<li>6-3 In cases where the Company assigns its rights and obligations due to
							business transfer or merger, the Company must notify the customers in advance
							about the reason for such assignment, information on the assignee and procedure
							for assignment upon posting such information on the front page of its website
							for at least thirty days and at the same time specifically notifying such
							information in writing, via email or by other means for more than once. The
							Company will grant the customers a right to agree or withdraw from certain
							matters relating to Personal Information. However, if, in connection with the
							notification in writing or via email, the Company is unable to find the contact
							information of the customers without any fault on the part of the Company, or
							there is a valid reason why the Company was unable to notify the customers of
							such information due to occurrence of the acts of God, the Company may publicly
							notify about such information through two or more major newspapers or magazines
							at least once.</li>
						<li>6-4. In the occurrence of any of the following events notwithstanding Articles
							6-1 through 6-3, such event shall be considered as an exception to such
							Articles:

									calculating the ‘mileage’ points owing to the provision of services;

									statistical study, academic research or market study, and such Personal
									Information will be revised so as not to disclose the identity of a
									certain individual;</li>
								<li>- if the Personal Information will be provided to a third party
									(including research institution, survey/research company, partner,
									etc.); and</li>
								<li>- if the Personal Information is required under the Act on Real Name
									Financial Transactions and Guarantee of Secrecy, the Use of Protection
									of Credit Information Act, the Framework Act on Telecommunications, the
									Local Tax Act, the Framework Act on Consumers, the Bank of Korea Act,
									and the Criminal Procedure Act. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>6-5. In order to provide better services to its customers, the Company may
							provide or share the Personal Information to its partner. In such case, however,
							the relevant customer will be personally asked in advance, via e-mail, to agree
							to the provision or sharing of Personal Information after being notified about
							important details, such as the name of partner, list of Personal Information
							that will be provided or shared with the partner, reason for provision or
							sharing of his/her Personal Information with the partner. As such, if our client
